/****** 
 * Usage of PROGMEM
 * -----------------
 * PROGMEM is used to store variables in flash memory (program memory) instead of SRAM. 
 * This is particularly useful on microcontrollers with limited SRAM.
 * To decide whether a string should be stored in PROGMEM, we consider its length and its access frequency.
 * - If the string is long and accessed rarely, it should be stored in PROGMEM.
 * - Else, it should remain in SRAM for performance reasons.
