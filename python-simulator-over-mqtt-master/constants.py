class MqttAppConstants:
    ############################### ALL CONSTANTS MUST BE DECLARED HERE AND UPDATED WHEN NECESSARY ###########################
    #################################### ADD a new mode, broker or command when necessary ####################################

    ######## Mode
    # if you add a new mode here which is quite unlikely to happen, you need to add a new mode in mode in the mode folder and update get_modes
    MODE_SENSOR = "sensor"
    MODE_SERVER = "server"
    MODE_WSS_CLIENT_OVER_MQTT = "client" # YOU NEED TO USE BROKER THAT SUPPPORTS WeSockets over MQTT (like hivemq)

    ######## Available broker 
    # if you add a new broker here, please complete brokerInformator.py and update get_brokers
    LOCAL = "local"
    MOSQUITTO = "mosquitto"
    HIVEMQ = "hivemq"

    ####### Topic duplication
    # Topic duplication in order to allow 1:1 communication beetween the sensor and the servor
    # A broker node cannot be both published and subscribed to the same topic. Every time it spoke on the topic,
    # it would receive his own message; this can go on forever... So I duplicated the topic into two “sub branches”.
    # A branch on which one listens and the other speaks and vice versa.

    # Example: sensor wants to listen to what the servor has to said so that it can receive its commands => How to procede ?
    # Just ask yourself, from who you want to gather data from. From the servor? alright subscribe to HEARING_FROM_SERVER and speak
    # and the other (and vice versa)

    HEARING_FROM_SENSOR =  "/sensor"
    HEARING_FROM_SERVER =  "/server"

    ####### Servor commands
    # Servor command for controlling the sensor
    # if you add a new command here, you need to update both sensorMode.py and servorMode.py =>
    # Indeed, the sensor must be able to process the new command and the server must be able to send it ! Also update get_commands
    COMMAND_PING = "ping"
    COMMAND_START = "start"
    COMMAND_STOP = "stop"

    ####### Sensor answers
    # The sensor answeres the server command
    PING_RESPONSE = "pong"                                    # Means the sensor is online
    PING_RESPONSE_WHEN_ALREADY_PUBLISHING = "pong.publishing" # Means the sensor is online but already publishing
    START_RESPONSE = "start.publishing"                       # Means the sensor has started to publish
    STOP_RESPONSE = "stop.publishing"                         # Means the sensor has stopped the publication of values

    ###### Message fields,
    # ----- SERVER
    # always sends {timestamp: time, cmd: command}
    # ----- SENSOR

    # 2) sends time series values, a json {timestamp: time, value: val}
